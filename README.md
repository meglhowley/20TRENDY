## _About 20TRENDY_

20TRENDY is an interpretation of a "doom scroll" through the year that changed life as we have come to know it. It is a full stack application with a back-end powered by Pytrend, Google Trend's unofficial API. 20TRENDY allows users to search trending searches at different intervals through 2020, based on what was occuring at the time.
